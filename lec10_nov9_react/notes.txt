- createRoot() injects HTML into the root element 

Fragment
- just a container that holds child elements (dummy container)

install extensions..
- ES7 + React/Redux/React

- takes 2 arguments (a callback function, and options)
- the callback function can take fetch(), cors functions etc.. 


const [pokemon, setPokemon] = React.useState([])
'setPokemon' sets the data into the 'pokemon' list variable


next week lab
- app.use(express.static('./public'))
- copy the pokemon assignment folder and the react app folder 


React rules:
1. every component should start with a capital letter (ie. Pokemon.js)
2. to pass data into a function (component), use the 'props' property
