In JS, there are built-in error handlers
- RangeError
- ReferenceError
- SyntaxError
- TypeError

Special results
ie. when there was an exception, do you remember returning a (-1) because you didn't know what to send as a response? --> concept of "special result"

make sure to know "instanceof" usage
- used for err.name and err.message
